                    Students at CHS are aware that the MYP is based on
                    conceptual understanding. This helps them develop
                    principles, generalizations and theories that they take

                    subjects. Each subject group has four key concepts.

                    There are two types of assessments in the MYP, which include:
                    Formative assessments: are assessments that take place during instruction (end of class,
                    unit…etc.) in order for
                    teachers to gauge where learning gaps are still evident and to make adjustments to instruction.
                    Formative
                    assessments are not recorded within MYP official grades.
                    Summative assessments: allow students to transfer their knowledge and skills, formally measured
                    by achievement
                    levels within a criterion. (Differs from one subject group to another and from one level to
                    another). Summative
                    assessments are criterion based. There are related assessment criteria for each summative task.
                    Each subject group
                    has four prescribed criteria based on age-appropriate objectives. The objectives are the same
                    from year to another
                    but differ in their complexity. These criteria are applied when making a summative judgment
                    about student’s
                    achievement.

                    his/her performance in the task. The total grade in an MYP subject is 32. Each criterion is out

                        Learning in the MYP uses global contexts in order to allow students to always ask the WHY?
                        This encourages students
                        to look at the subject matter through multiple/ different perspectives (points of view)
                        building on the idea that there
                        is more than a way to understand one another and to link knowledge to the world we live in.

                        learning styles, learning difficulties and special educational needs.

                        Teachers and students incorporate technology in order to establish a wide range of sources
                        of information that
                        enhance teaching and learning. At CHS students are free to use the school library anytime
                        and teachers usually take
                        students to the MYP research lab to allow them to use a different range of sources.

                        An essential part of the MYP is service as action. The programme believes in the importance

                        serve themselves, their families and the surrounding community. Each year, MYP students

                        implementation depends on the school’s concern for the whole educational experience,

                        This usually takes the form of questions, drawing, oral or written. At CHS each student has
                        a reflection logbook
                        divided into 8 binders (for the eight subject groups) and stays in school as this is
