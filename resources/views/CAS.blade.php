                        CAS enables students to enhance their personal and
                        interpersonal development. A meaningful CAS programme
                        is a journey of discovery of self and others. For many, CAS is
                        profound and life-changing. Each individual student has a
                        different starting point and different needs and goals. A CAS
                        programme is, therefore, individualized according to
                        student interests, skills, values and background.

                        The school and students must give CAS as much importance
                        as any other element of the Diploma Programme and
                        ensure sufficient time is allocated for engagement in the
                        CAS programme. The CAS stages offer a helpful and
                        supportive framework and continuum of process for CAS
                        students. Successful completion of CAS is a requirement for
                        the award of the IB Diploma.

                        The CAS programme formally begins at the start of the
                        Diploma Programme and continues regularly, ideally on a
                        weekly basis, for at least 18 months with a reasonable
                        balance between creativity, activity, and service.
                        All CAS students are expected to maintain and complete a

                    4.Reflection: Students describe what happened, express
                    feelings, generate ideas, and raise questions. Reflection can
                    occur at any time during CAS to further understanding, to assist
                    with revising plans, to learn from the experience, and to make
                    explicit connections between their growth, accomplishments,
                    and the learning outcomes for personal awareness. Reflection
                    may lead to new action.

                    5.Demonstration: Students make explicit what and how they
                    learned and what they have accomplished, for example, by
                    sharing their CAS experience through their CAS portfolio or
                    with others in an informal or formal manner. Through
                    demonstration and communication, students solidify their
                    understanding and evoke response from others.
